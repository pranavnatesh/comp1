# Computation I 22/23 - C programming exercises

Hi guys, I created this repository to revise for my C programming exam and to learn Github along the way. Unfortunately, I cannot also share the homework description PDFs because they are copyrighted material. 

If this was useful to you, please consider starring the repo!

This Repo will ~~no longer~~ be updated with new exercises or fixes/additions to existing ones.

Edit 24/1/2023:
"Als je op die github van jouw nog verder wil uitbreiden kun je die code van mij er opzich wel op pleuren" - Cis
Alternate/New solutions for each homework now available!

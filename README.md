# Computation I 22/23 - C programming exercises

Hi guys, I created this repository to revise for my C programming exam and to learn Github along the way. Unfortunately, I cannot also share the homework description PDFs because they are copyrighted material. 

If this was useful to you, please consider starring the repo!

This Repo will no longer be updated with new exercises or fixes/additions to existing ones :(

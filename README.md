# Computation I 22/23 - C programming exercises

I created this repository to revise for my C programming exam and to learn Github along the way. Now featuring additional solutions from Cis Leveau.
Unfortunately, I cannot also share the homework description PDFs because they are copyrighted material. 

If this was useful to you, please consider starring the repo!
